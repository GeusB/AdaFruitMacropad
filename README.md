# AdaFruitMacropad
WIP
A custom layered layout with macro/function for my Adafruit Macropad


# stuff I will to try change/implement:
 Key pressed = continue to do the macro/keypress/...
 Cursor mover
 Extract 12 (keycount)
 Cleanup max_layer - 1 stuff 
 Git ... + Enter/Return => Crash but seems to happen only when in bash
 Try to run function from macro_array 
 Switch back to button press for switching layer => encoder press??
 Clock in title
 Fix readme :-D
