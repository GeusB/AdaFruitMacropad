# AdaFruitMacropad
WIP  
A custom layered layout with macro/function for my Adafruit Macropad  
loosely based on
[Adafruits samples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/271b3fee5b3b15a8f029359891974102d6b57450/Macropad_Hotkeys/code.py "Adafruit Github")



# Stuff I will to try change/implement:
 Key pressed = continue to do the macro/keypress/...  
 Cursor mover  
 Git ... + Enter/Return => Crash but seems to happen only when in bash   
 Clock in title
