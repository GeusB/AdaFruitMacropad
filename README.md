WIP
A custom layered layout with macro/function for my Adafruit Macropad


# Stuff I will to try change/implement:
 Key pressed = continue to do the macro/keypress/...  
 Cursor mover  
 Extract 12 (keycount)  
 Cleanup max_layer - 1 stuff  
 Git ... + Enter/Return => Crash but seems to happen only when in bash   
 Clock in title  
 Fix readme :-D  
 Add reference and license info
